DMURLConnection

For when you just need to download some data. Sort of.

DMURLConnection has only been used on the iPhone.
DMURLConnection does a weird self-retain.
DMURLConnection retains its delegate.
DMURLConnection is self-released when either of its delegate methods are called.

Comments, contributions, questions, all are welcome.

Example usage:
-(void)getConfigFile {
	NSMutableURLRequest *urlRequest = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:EB_PNS_RETRIEVE_URL]];
	[urlRequest setHTTPMethod:@"POST"];
	NSMutableDictionary *dict = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithCapacity:6];
	[dict setValue:[[UIDevice currentDevice] uniqueIdentifier] forKey:@"UUID"];
	[dict setValue:[[NSNumber numberWithDouble:currentLoc.latitude] stringValue] forKey:APN_D_LAT];
	[dict setValue:[[NSNumber numberWithDouble:currentLoc.longitude] stringValue] forKey:APN_D_LON];
	
	[dict setValue:[defaults objectForKey:APN_PREF_NEWS] forKey:APN_PREF_NEWS];
	[dict setValue:[defaults objectForKey:APN_PREF_DEALS] forKey:APN_PREF_DEALS];
	[dict setValue:[defaults objectForKey:APN_PREF_EVENTS] forKey:APN_PREF_EVENTS];
		
	NSDictionary *staticDict = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithDictionary:dict];
	[urlRequest setHTTPBody:[staticDict urlEncodedDataUTF8]];

	[DMURLConnection connectToRequest:urlRequest withDelegate:self];
}

Delegate methods:
-(void)connectionFinishedLoadingWithData:(NSMutableData *)rd; // manditory
-(void)connectionFailedWithError:(NSError *)error; // optional

Helper:
urlEncodedDataUTF8 is a category on NSDictionary. It's included for convenience, but you may or may not need it.
